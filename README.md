MeqTrees is a software package for implementing Measurement Equations. This makes it uniquely suited for simulation and calibration of radioastronomical data, especially that involving new radiotelescopes and observational regimes.

MeqTrees includes a highly capable FITS viewer and sky model manager called "Tigger", which can also work as a standalone tool.
